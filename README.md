THIS IS MY 3RD TASK AS A WEB DEV INTERN IN SCT!
This task involves developing a dynamic quiz application that presents questions to users, collects their responses, and calculates a final score. 
The quiz supports multiple question types such as single-select, multi-select, and fill-in-the-blank questions, demonstrating conditional rendering, user input validation, and score tracking.
